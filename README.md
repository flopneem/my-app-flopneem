# my-app
This is the code repository for lab and project applications for CSC 142.

## This is the repository for Labs 1-4, and your application/project

## Class Organization
Components of a Class must be listed in the following order:
* constants (logical grouping/alphabetical order)
* data fields (logical grouping/alphabetical order )
* constructors (in order of increasing parameters in alphabetical order)
* methods (alphabetical order) Note: overloaded methods (in order of increasing parameters in alphabetical order)
* inner classes (alphabetical order)


## Code Assessment
Things that matter:
* modular programming design and examples.testing
* submitted on GitHub and organized in specified packages
* limited comments, i.e. code must be readable and easy to understand without comments
* code is without errors or warnings when instructor runs your application
* solves the problem


## Programming Skills Assessment includes the following:
* APPROPRIATE    : does what the "client"/"client program" wants it to do.
* CORRECT        : solve a problem as intended.
* ECONOMICAL     : produced on time and under budget / fairly priced. For you, this boils down to being on time!
* EFFICIENT      : doesn't take too long to run or take up too much memory or other resources when running.
* MAINTAINABLE   : issues/bugs can be easily found, isolated and fixed.
* PREDICTABLE    : behaves as expected (no surprises!)
* RELIABLE       : doesn't crash.
* REUSABLE       : components can be used unchanged in other programs/applications.
* ROBUST         : handle errors or unsupported implementations through validation checks and logging alerts when running programs.
* SCALABLE       : new features can be added without excessive changes to existing code or impacting its run time performance.
* UNDERSTANDABLE : you can look at the source code and easily tell what it does.


### Writing effective code 
This assessment includes the following:
* how well action words were used for the methods/functions, and to define their functionality(what they actually do)
* how well you loops and/or methods were used to shorten lines of code that are repetitive.
* how well names were used to make understandable identifiers for methods, variables etc.
* how well code one-liners were used to give better readability and understanding of the code.
* how much growth has been shown throughout course.
  * does the code have a modular design?
  * is the code readable?
  * does it solve the problem in an efficient way?
